      <center>ABOUT THIS SITE</center><br>
      This site was created with images of nesting dolls, brown stains on white carpet, and venn
      diagrams in mind. I want to show that all areas of practice (drawing, sculpture, writing, and
      performance/video) are separate, but often bleed into one another.<br><br>
      Thank you <a href="http://ritual.engineer/">Herdimas Anggara</a> for guiding me through this process and coding it into
      existence!<br><br><br><br><br>
